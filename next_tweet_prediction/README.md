## Next Tweet Prediction

To evaluate model coherence, we design a next tweet prediction (NTP) task
that is similar to the next sentence prediction (NSP) task used to train BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). In
NTP, each instance consists of a Twitter thread (2â€“4 tweets) that we call the premise, and four possible
options for the next tweet, one of which is the actual response from the original thread.

The experiment is not based on 5-fold cross validation as we ensure that there is no overlap between the next tweet
candidates in the training and test sets.

* Train: 5681 threads
* Development: 811 threads 
* Test: 1890 threads
